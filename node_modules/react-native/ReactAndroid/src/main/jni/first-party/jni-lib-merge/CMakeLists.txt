# This is the 'glue' library responsible of allowing to do so-merging in React Native
# OSS. This library contains just a .c file that is included in every merged library.
#
# The header file is included in every merged library during compilation and takes care
# of the redefinition of the JNI_OnLoad function to JNI_OnLoad_Weak.
#
# More on this mechanism: https://github.com/fbsamples/android-native-library-merging-demo
